Text: Whitney approached me with ideas for creating her client gifts, but needed help designing the packaging elements. Together, we brainstormed ways to wrap and ship the pieces, while remaining consistent with her brand (logo design by (link: http://www.laurenledbetter.com text: Lauren Ledbetter)).

I sourced kraft boxes for shipping and crumpled black kraft paper for padding. I selected paper for the labels and wrapping the gifts after testing various weights and colors. I also designed labels and a letter written by Whitney for her clients.

The following images feature early packaging concepts. The final version is currently in production.
