Inspired by the work of Japanese graphic designer Kenya Hara, I designed a candle and a package that focus on aesthetic details in order to influence the consumer’s “standard of desire.”

A smooth, natural wooden lid covers a hand-poured candle, scented with notes of cinnamon and evergreen. The name Aspen draws to mind cozy winters spent among the snow-covered mountains of Colorado. The flannel-lined drawstring bag is soft to the touch, adding a luxurious feel to this reusable keepsake.

I had so much fun dreaming up this project and bringing it to life. Many thanks to Candle Makers on the Square for helping me create the scent and pour the candle, and to my friend Emily for helping me sew the bag.
