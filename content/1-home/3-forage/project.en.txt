#Branding for a new plant + curated home goods shop in Louisville, KY

Jamie came to me with her plans for a new business that would combine her love for plants with a calm, minimal space to host workshops and events. She was still searching for the perfect space, and even sent me walkthrough videos of places she was considering.

It has been so exciting to work with Jamie to build Forage's brand from the ground up. Not only is Forage one-of-a-kind in Louisville, but it's also the first comprehensive branding project that I've had the opportunity to design. From post cards and window decals to an LED sign and a custom Shopify website, Jamie has everything she needs to run a professional, successful business. 

From Jamie, upon receiving her logo concepts:

"Omg! I seriously felt like a kid on Christmas when I woke up this morning! This is SO  amazing!

I've been going back and forth for about 30 minutes now on each concept&mdash;it has been reallllly hard for me to choose because both are so good and both have different qualities. But, I think I am sold on Concept I. I think that the typeface is unique but can still hold its longevity&mdash;also. The leaf!!! 

These are so, so fantastic! Thank you so so much! I'm probably just going to stare at them all day!"
