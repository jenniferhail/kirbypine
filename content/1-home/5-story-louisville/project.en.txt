Story Louisville is a new co-working space that aims to inspire meaningful relationships, creativity, and community in Louisville, Kentucky. Located in the beautifully renovated Butchertown Market building, Story has already drawn the interest of many creative entrepreneurs in the city thanks to its fun atmosphere and great perks of membership.

When Natalia approached me with excitement and drive to bring her idea to life, I was more than eager to help her create a brand for such a great purpose. She dreamt of transforming the empty space beside her photography studio into a co-working space that would benefit others more than herself. Because entrepreneurs often find themselves working from home or coffee shops, alone, they face difficulties creating fresh work, maintaining efficiency and focus, and lacking a source of accountability. Story Louisville solves all of these problems by gathering some of Louisville's makers, doers, and dreamers to help their businesses succeed and relationships flourish.

I created a handlettered logo to capture the energy of the space, while attracting her target market of young entrepreneurs in creative fields. We selected a palette of bright primary colors—implemented in furnishings and artwork around the room—to communicate the space's contemporary, energetic, and inspiring feel.
