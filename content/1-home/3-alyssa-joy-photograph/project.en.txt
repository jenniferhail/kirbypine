Text: Together, Alyssa and I worked to create a new website that would showcase her photographs simply and beautifully. She wanted visitors to not only leave with a very clear vision of what she does, but to also feel peaceful, uplifted, and joyful. After spending a few minutes on her site, it's easy to feel like you know her and the heart behind her passion for film photography.

*Launching early 2016*
