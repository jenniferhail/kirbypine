It's giving you the confidence to know how you stand out in your industry. And it's creating a brand that clearly communicates your value, so you can stop questioning your prices.

Aboutme: 

#Founder & Designer, Jennifer Hail

Pine begain in the fall of 2015 by Jennifer Hail, located in Louisville, Kentucky.

Jennifer is a graphic designer who works to create minimal, beautiful solutions for passionate creatives and makers. Her focus is to create a breath of fresh air in a world filled with clutter, through a simplified process that eliminates the overwhelm. Jennifer's knowledge of front-end web development and natural inclination to film photography allows her to offer a holistic approach to the needs of her clients.

She is inspired by slow living and purposeful past times, often dabbling in a selection of hobbies including calligraphy, coffee-making, and curating. Jennifer believes that less is always more, and encourages everyone to never stop learning. When she isn't on the computer designing or reading articles, you can find her entertaining her fluffy, white cat Theodore and spending time with her fianc√© and family.
