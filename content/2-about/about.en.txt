#Welcome to Pine

At the heartwood* of our studio lies the desire to bring the passionate ideas of creative entrepreneurs to life. We believe in the power of beautiful photography, compelling words, good design, and authentic friendship. 

We long to partner with people who value the short life we’ve been given by spending it pursuing meaningful, fulfilling work. They live adventurously, and love fiercely. They choose less when the world yells more.

#Founder & Designer, Jennifer Hail

Jennifer is a graphic designer who works to create minimal, beautiful solutions for passionate creatives and makers. Her focus is to create a breath of fresh air in a world filled with clutter, through a simplified process that eliminates the overwhelm. Jennifer's knowledge of front-end web development and natural inclination to film photography allows her to offer a holistic approach to the needs of her clients.

She is inspired by slow living and purposeful past times, often dabbling in a selection of hobbies including calligraphy, coffee-making, and curating. Jennifer believes that less is always more, and encourages everyone to never stop learning. When she isn't on the computer designing or reading articles, you can find her entertaining her fluffy, white cat Theodore and spending time with her fiancé and family.
