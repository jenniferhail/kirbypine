Be sure to include
- A snippet from the adventure workbook
- Mood boards from the discovery document
- Working with Mallory to develop the olive branch illustration
- Adding personality and emotion to her Squarespace website
- Why I loved working with Alyssa (sneaky way to talk about the clients I want to work with) &mdash; easy going, Pinterest-savy, simple and calm, quiet, but confident in her skills and beliefs. Very aware of who she is.

Everything I did for her
- Brand strategy
- Mood boards
- Presentation of her logo concept
- Presentation of her brand palette concept
- Logo mark with additional options of a alternate logo, wordmark, monogram, and seal
- Brand manual (a guide explaining how to implement and use her branding)

- Setup of Google Analytics, Google My Business, and Bing Web Search

Up next!
