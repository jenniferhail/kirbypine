#A Community for Creative Entrepreneurs

Growing our businesses begins with the confidence that we are creating something that matters, something that gives value to the people who buy from us. This confidence is found when we stop trying to go it alone and instead choose to rely on our community, our Forest. 


By simply asking for help, advice, or a fresh opinion, we find the voices we forgot we had, the talents we brushed under the rug, and the clarity that was shrouded by comparison. 


I believe that this community—filled with creatives who are building deeply-rooted businesses—can impact our lives. No longer will we feel alone or in the dark on this entrepreneurial journey. We will feel invested in and find others to care for and empower.

#How It Works

The Forest is a private Facebook group of business owners who seek mentorship and community. Our goal is to help each other create businesses that grow and thrive, resulting in increased inquiries, clients, profits, and opportunities.

Each month's conversation will focus on an area of business where we can use guidance, refinement, and growth. Topics (or branches, as we like to call them) will be sourced from member applications, requests from the group, and topics that come up in our conversations, in order to make your membership worthwhile. 

Although connecting online is great, finding a mentor and talking face-to-face will push us toward our goals much faster when we have real-life accountability. Every member of The Forest will be paired with two members: one as a mentor and one as a mentoree. 

To be clear, this group isn't about self-promotion or finding new clients. While both things may occur organically, our main focus is to help each other grow and, ultimately, succeed.

#The Rules

- Each member will be added to a member directory
- Each member will be paired with a mentor
- Each member will mentor another member of best fit
- Only apply if you are ready to be involved in a supportive community
- You are expected to contribute to conversation in the Facebook group at least once a month
- If you are not involved in conversation over a span of two consecutive months, you will receive a reminder. If a third month of no contribution occurs, you will be removed from the group.
