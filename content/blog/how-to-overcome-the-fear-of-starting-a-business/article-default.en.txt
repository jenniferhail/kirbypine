Title: How to Overcome the Fear of Starting a Business

----

Text: 

Before I had worked up the nerve to turn in my two-week notice at my last full-time job, the thought that nearly suffocated my dream of starting a design studio was that *I was afraid*. For months prior, all I knew was that starting a business scared me. 

My self-doubt circled around three questions: 
1. What if I failed? 
2. What if I couldn't get clients and make enough money to support myself? 
3. What if I had to go back to a regular job, working for someone else? 

Maybe you're feeling and thinking these things, too. If so, I hope this post is informative and gives you direction to face your fear with action.


##From Abstract to Concrete

As I continued to sit on my hands and worry about the what-ifs, I realized somethingâ€”the answers to my fears weren't that scary.  

First, how would I define failure? What if failure was never trying to start a business and make it happen? Replacing that abstract, open-ended feeling with a concrete definition helped to melt away my anxiety.

Second, if I wasn't bringing in enough money, I could get a part-time job (or two) to help make the transition less stressful. And that I did. Before I told my boss of my plans, I had secured a position assisting a local photographer (the incredible (link: http://www.whitneynealphoto.com text: Whitney Neal)) and a part-time job at Paper Source. 

And if I had to call it quits and return to the workforce, I knew that I would swallow my pride and do it. Although this ending might hurt my ego, I know that I would handle it like an adult and become even more motivated to make my business happen.



Starting a business is no small task. According to the (link: https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/advocacy/SB-FAQ-2016_WEB.pdf text: U.S. Small Business Administration), about 80% of new businesses started in 2014 survived their first year, and only half of them will last five years or longer. Although the odds may not be in our favor, we don't have to let a statistic keep us from pursuing our passion and becoming our own boss. 

##Why are we afraid?

- We don't know how to start
- We don't think we'll make any money
- We don't see the unique value we can provide in the saturated industry

##How to overcome the fear

###Make a plan
- Define the service or product you want to offer.
- Find other businesses already doing what you want to do and learn from them.
- Work backwards from there.

- Make the numbers real
 - Become clear on how much money you need each month to survive
 - Add on x% for taxes. (30% is the average)
 - Add on a bit more to put back for investing in your business.
 - Now, calculate the costs of running your business and serving your clients. (Business expenses)
 - Add all of these numbers up (multiply by 12) to figure out how much money you need to make in a year/month.
 - Once you have that number, determine how many clients you can work with, or how many products you need to sell in the year to reach that number.
